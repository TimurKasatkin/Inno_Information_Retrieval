Modern Hebrew is phonetically simpler than Biblical Hebrew and has fewer phonemes, but it is phonologically more complex. It has 25 to 27 consonants and 8 to 10 vowels, depending on the speaker and the analysis.
Hebrew has been used primarily for liturgical, literary, and scholarly purposes for most of the past two millennia. As a consequence, its pronunciation was strongly influenced by the vernacular of individual Jewish communities. With the revival of Hebrew as a native language, and especially with the establishment of Israel, the pronunciation of the modern language rapidly coalesced.
The two main accents of modern Hebrew are Oriental and Non-Oriental. Oriental Hebrew was chosen as the preferred accent for Israel by the Academy of the Hebrew Language, but has since declined in popularity. The description in this article follows the language as it is pronounced by native Israeli speakers of the younger generations. 
According to the Academy of the Hebrew Language, in the 1880s (the time of the beginning of the Zionist movement and the Hebrew revival) there were three groups of Hebrew regional accents: Ashkenazi (Eastern European), Sephardi (Southern European), and Mizrahi (Middle Eastern, Iranian, and North African). Over time features of these systems of pronunciation merged, and nowadays we find two main pronunciations of colloquial – not liturgical – Hebrew: Oriental and Non-Oriental. Oriental Hebrew displays traits of an Arabic substrate.Oriental speakers tend to use an alveolar trill  rather than a uvular trill  or a velar fricative , preserve the pharyngeal consonants  and (less commonly) , preserve gemination, and pronounce  in some places where non-Oriental speakers do not have a vowel (the shva na). Some Oriental speakers maintain a few of the emphatic consonants also found in Arabic, such as  for Biblical .
Non-Oriental (and General Israeli) pronunciation lost the emphatic and pharyngeal sounds of Biblical Hebrew under the influence of Indo-European languages (Germanic and Slavic for Ashkenazim and Romance for Sephardim). The pharyngeals  and  are preserved by older Oriental speakers.Dialectically, Georgian Jews pronounce  as , while Western European Sephardim and Dutch Ashkenazim traditionally pronounce it , a pronunciation that can also be found in the Italian tradition and, historically, in south-west Germany. However, according to Sephardic and Ashkenazic authorities, such as the Mishneh Berurah and the Shulchan Aruch and Mishneh Torah, // is the proper pronunciation. Thus, it is still pronounced as such by some Sephardim and Ashkenazim.
The classical pronunciation associated with the consonant r  was a flap , and was grammatically ungeminable. In most dialects of Hebrew among the Jewish diaspora, it remained a flap or a trill . However, in some Ashkenazi dialects of northern Europe it was a uvular rhotic, either a trill  or a fricative . This was because most native dialects of Yiddish were spoken that way, and the liturgical Hebrew of these speakers carried the Yiddish pronunciation. Some Iraqi Jews also pronounce r as a guttural , reflecting Baghdad Jewish Arabic. An apparently unrelated uvular rhotic is believed to have appeared in the Tiberian vocalization of Hebrew, where it is believed to have coexisted with additional non-guttural articulations of /r/ depending on circumstances. In Modern Israeli Hebrew, the dominant pronunciation is a velar fricative, , which sounds similar to .
Though an Ashkenazi Jew in the Russian Empire, the Zionist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, based his Standard Hebrew on Sephardi Hebrew originally spoken in Spain and therefore recommended an alveolar . The first waves of Jews to resettle in the Holy Land were northern Ashkenazi, and Standard Hebrew would come to be spoken with their preferred uvular articulation as found in Yiddish or modern standard German. Nearly all Jews of Israel now speak Hebrew with a uvular r because of its modern prestige and historical elite status.
Many Jewish immigrants to Israel spoke a variety of Arabic in their countries of origin, and pronounced the Hebrew rhotic consonant /r/ as an alveolar trill, identical to Arabic  , and which followed the conventions of old Hebrew. Under pressure to assimilate, many of them began pronouncing their Hebrew rhotic as a voiced uvular or velar fricative, often identical to Arabic   . However, in modern Askenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi poetry and folk music, as well as in the standard (or "standardised") Hebrew used in the Israeli media, an alveolar rhotic is sometimes used.
The Hebrew word for consonants is  (). The following table lists the consonant phonemes of Israeli Hebrew in IPA transcription:
Obstruents assimilate in voicing. Voiceless obstruents (stops/affricates  and fricatives ) become voiced () when they appear immediately before voiced obstruents, and vice versa. For example: 
 is pronounced  before velar consonants.
Standard Israeli Hebrew (SIH) phonology has undergone a number of splits and mergers in its development from Biblical Hebrew (BH).
The consonant pairs ~, ~, and ~ were historically allophonic, as a consequence of a phenomenon of spirantisation known as begadkefat. In Modern Hebrew, the six sounds are phonemic. Similar allophonic alternation of BH ~, ~ and ~ was lost, with the allophones merging into simple , though  has reappeared from BH  in the accent of the majority of the population. 
These phonemic changes were partly due to the mergers noted above, to the loss of consonant gemination, which had distinguished stops from their fricative allophones in intervocalic position, and the introduction of syllable-initial  and non-syllable-initial  and  in loan words. Spirantization still occurs in verbal and nominal derivation, but now the alternations ~, ~, and ~ are phonemic rather than allophonic.
The Hebrew word for vowels is  (). Hebrew has nine vowel phonemes, five short and four long:
Long vowels occur where two identical vowels were historically separated by a pharyngeal or glottal consonant, and the first was stressed. (Where the second was stressed, the result is a sequence of two short vowels.) They also often occur when morphology brings two identical vowels together, but they are not predictable in that environment.
Any of the five short vowels may be realized as a schwa  when far from lexical stress.
There are two diphthongs,  and .
In Biblical Hebrew, each vowel had three forms: short, long and interrupted (). However, there is no audible distinction between the three in Modern Hebrew, except that  is often pronounced  as in Ashkenazi Hebrew.
Vowel length in Modern Hebrew is environmentally determined and not phonemic, it tends to be affected by the degree of stress, and pretonic lengthening may also occur, mostly in open syllables. When a glottal is lost, a two-vowel sequence arises, and they may be merged into a single long vowel:
Modern pronunciation does not follow traditional use of the niqqud (diacritic) "shva". In Modern Hebrew, words written with a shva may be pronounced with either  or without any vowel (or sometimes as an actual schwa), and this does not correspond well to how the word was pronounced historically. For example, the first shva in the word  'you (fem.) crumpled' is pronounced  () though historically it was silent, whereas the shva in  ('time'), which was pronounced historically, is usually silent (). Orthographic shva is generally pronounced  in prefixes such as ve- ('and') and be- ('in'), or when following another shva in grammatical patterns, as in  ('you [f. sg.] will learn'). An epenthetic  appears when necessary to avoid violating a phonological constraint, such as between two consonants that are identical or differ only in voicing (e.g.  'I learned', not ) or when an impermissible initial cluster would result (e.g.  or , where C stands for any consonant).
Stress is phonemic in Modern Hebrew. There are two frequent patterns of lexical stress, on the last syllable ( ) and on the penultimate syllable ( ). Final stress has traditionally been more frequent, but in the colloquial language many words are shifting to penultimate stress. Contrary to the prescribed standard, some words exhibit stress on the antepenultimate syllable or even further back. This often occurs in loanwords, e.g.   ('politics'), and sometimes in native colloquial compounds, e.g.   ('somehow'). Colloquial stress has often shifted from the last syllable to the penultimate, e.g.  'hat', normative , colloquial ;  ('dovecote'), normative , colloquial . This shift is common in the colloquial pronunciation of many personal names, for example  ('David'), normative , colloquial .
Historically, stress was predictable, depending on syllable weight (that is, vowel length and whether a syllable ended with a consonant). Because spoken Israeli Hebrew has lost gemination (a common source of syllable-final consonants) as well as the original distinction between long and short vowels, but the position of the stress often remained where it had been, stress has become phonemic, as the following table illustrates. Phonetically, the following word pairs differ only in the location of the stress; orthographically they differ also in the written representation of vowel length of the vowels (assuming the vowels are even written):
When a vowel falls beyond two syllables from the main stress of a word or phrase, it may be reduced or elided. For example:
When  follows an unstressed vowel, it is elided, sometimes with the surrounding vowels:
Syllables  drop before  except at the end of a prosodic unit:
but:   ('he is on his way') at the end of a prosodic unit.
Sequences of dental stops reduce to a single consonant, again except at the end of a prosodic unit:
but:   ('that I studied')
